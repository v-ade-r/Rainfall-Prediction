# Rainfall-Prediction
ML in classification problem.

Objective: Predicting whether next day will rain.

This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package

You can learn from this code how to:

1. **Prepare data** with target value highly **unbalanced**, by resampling.
2. **Fill NaNs with IterativeImputer** based on multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE)
3. **Create new feature**s.
4. **Test ML models and tune hyperparameters** of the most efficient ML models for classification (with Optuna).
